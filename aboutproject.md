What it's about:
The goal was to analyze data from a used car listing site to understand what factors influence car sales.

What was done:
I used SQL to clean the data by removing duplicates and fixing inconsistent values. Then, I wrote queries to find which fuel types, brands, and prices were most preferred by buyers.

Why it matters:
This project helps car sellers understand what customers want, so they can stock and promote the right kind of cars.
